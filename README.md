Everything we've learned about Git &amp; GitHub

## What is Git?
Git is a version control tool

Git has 3 main states that your file can be contained within: 

-``` Working Directory```

The file has been altered but not yet committed to your database yet.

-```Staging Area```

Once added with the git command, this modified file is  being tracked by Git and is ready to be committed.

-```Committed```

Altered file is now stored in the local database.
