Everything we've learned about Git &amp; GitHub

## What is Git?
Git is a version control tool

Git has 3 main states that your file can be contained within: 

-``` working directory```

The file has been altered but not yet committed to your database yet.

-```staging area```

Once added with the git command, this modified file is  being tracked by Git and is ready to be committed.

-```committed```

Altered file is now stored in the local database.

## Restore, Revert and Reset

#### For undoing changes in development, there are 3 different commands

```restore```

This command 'restores' a file to its previously defined state - not updating your development history.

```revert```

Creates a new commit that reverts the changes made by other commits

```Reset```

Breaks source code beyond a desired commit. Updates your branch and changes commit history.
